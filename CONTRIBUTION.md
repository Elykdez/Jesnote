# Contributing to Jasnote

Jasnote is a Windows desktop JSON/JSONL viewer with one job: open files measured in gigabytes, with element counts in the tens of millions, and let the user navigate without OOM or UI freezes.
Every architectural decision flows from that constraint. Before changing anything that touches parsing, the tree document, or rendering, read this file.

## Build and run

Requires the .NET 8 SDK. From the repo root:

```powershell
.\run.bat                  # build + run (no file)
.\run.bat .\sample.json    # build + run with file argument
dotnet build .\src\Jasnote.csproj -c Release
```

The csproj enables `ServerGarbageCollection`, `ConcurrentGarbageCollection`, `TieredCompilation`, and `TieredPGO`. Do not turn these off without measuring.

## Release

Use `release.bat` from the repository root to prepare a local release commit and tag:

```powershell
.\release.bat 0.1.1
```

The script updates `<Version>` in `src\Jasnote.csproj`, builds the Release configuration, commits the current working-tree changes, and creates tag `v0.1.2` locally. It does not push anything automatically.

Review `git status` before running it because the script commits all current changes. When the local release looks correct, push the branch and tag manually:

```powershell
git push origin main v0.1.2
```

GitHub Actions will build and publish the release asset after the tag is pushed.

## Project layout

Put code in [src/Scripts](Scripts) and assets in [src/Resources](Resources).

## Performance budget

The README target: open documents above 2 GiB with 100M+ elements without heavy memory issues or UI freezes. Concretely:

Per-element heap cost stays at or under ~30 bytes plus a per-string-value entry. No intermediate fully-materialized JSON tree (no `JsonDocument`, no `Dictionary<string, object>`, no boxed value tree) is built; parsing writes directly to the compact representation. No per-element WinForms `TreeNode` exists; the tree is virtualized. Files larger than 1 GiB never get loaded as a single managed `byte[]`; they use the streaming/chunked path.

A full boxed object graph is usually several times larger than the input file and becomes the dominant memory cost on huge documents. Jasnote skips that step entirely. If you find yourself adding code that materializes the whole input as managed objects before scanning, stop and reconsider.

## Tree memory layout

Parallel arrays indexed by node id, defined in [JsonTreeDocument.cs](src/Scripts/Core/JsonTreeDocument.cs):

```text
byte[]    Types[i]        node type
string?[] Keys[i]         interned object key, or "[i]" for array elements
long[]    Values[i]       discriminated slot: double bits / string-pool index / 0|1 / unused
int[]     Parents[i]      parent id, or -1 for root
int[]     FirstChild[i]   first child id, or -1
int[]     NextSibling[i]  next sibling id, or -1
string[]  StringPool      sized exactly to the number of String nodes
```

Total: 29 bytes/node plus a string-pool entry only for string values. A hypothetical `class JsonNode` design (object header 24 bytes + fields + per-parent `List<int>` headers + boxed numbers) would be 80+ bytes/node and OOM well below the target.

Object keys use a per-parse `Dictionary<string, string>` interner. Typical JSON has fewer than 200 distinct property names regardless of document size; this collapses millions of duplicate key strings to one each. The dictionary lives in the `BuildContext` local and is GC'd as soon as parse finishes.

Children form a linked list (`FirstChild` + `NextSibling`) instead of a per-parent `List<int>`. Lists cost ~40 bytes of overhead each, and the document can have millions of parents. The linked-list cost is paid only in CPU when iterating children, which is rare on the hot path.

The `long Values[]` slot is a discriminated union driven by `Types[i]`. Numbers are stored as `BitConverter.DoubleToInt64Bits`. Strings are an index into `StringPool`. Booleans are 0/1. The boxed `ValueOf(id)` accessor exists for compatibility but should not be used on hot paths.

Array index keys (`[0]`, `[1]`, ...) are deduped via a static cache of 4096 entries so log-style documents do not allocate one short string per index.

When you add a node type or change the value layout, verify the per-node bytes are still bounded and update the comment block at the top of [JsonTreeDocument.cs](src/Core/JsonTreeDocument.cs).

## Parse pipeline

Four parse paths share the same `HandleToken` core and the same compact-array output:

```text
LoadAsync(path)              size <= 1 GiB    in-memory:  CountTokens + BuildFromSpan
                             size >  1 GiB    streaming:  CountFromStreamAsync + BuildFromStreamAsync
LoadAsync(byte[])            always in-memory
LoadAsync(path, jsonl=true)  size <= 1 GiB    in-memory:  CountJsonl + BuildJsonl
   .jsonl / .ndjson          size >  1 GiB    streaming:  CountJsonlFromStreamAsync + BuildJsonlFromStreamAsync
```

Every path runs two passes over the input. The count pass walks tokens and accumulates `TotalCount` and `StringCount` with no allocations beyond the reader state. The build pass calls `AllocateArrays(TotalCount, StringCount)` exactly once, then emits nodes into the pre-sized arrays.

Pre-sizing matters: `List` growth doubles capacity, which on a 100M-node array means a 400 MB to 800 MB resize copy at the worst moment. Two passes pay a 2x I/O cost (the OS page cache absorbs the second read for files smaller than RAM) but eliminate all reallocation during the build.

The streaming path uses `ArrayPool<byte>.Shared.Rent(InitialBufferSize)` (256 KiB initial) with chunked reads. If a single JSON token (typically a huge string literal) exceeds the buffer, the buffer doubles up to `MaxStreamChunkBuffer` (1 GiB). Beyond that, the parser throws an `InvalidDataException` with a clear message instead of OOM.

## JSONL

JSON Lines (`.jsonl`, `.ndjson`) puts one complete JSON document per line. .NET 8's `JsonReaderOptions` does not have `AllowMultipleValues` (that's a .NET 9 API), so the JSONL paths split on `\n` and parse each line independently with `Utf8JsonReader(line, isFinalBlock: true, default)`.

Each top-level value becomes a child of a synthetic Array root pre-seeded via `PushSyntheticJsonlRoot`. The synthetic root is hidden by the tree control, so the user sees the records as top-level siblings keyed `[0]`, `[1]`, ...

Detection is by file extension only ([MainForm.IsJsonlPath](src/MainForm.cs)). The picker filter is `*.json;*.jsonl;*.ndjson`. Trailing CR (CRLF) is stripped. Leading and trailing ASCII whitespace is stripped. Empty lines are skipped. A malformed line throws `JsonException` with the byte offset; the existing error dialog in `MainForm` displays it.

## UI virtualization

[VirtualJsonTree](src/Controls/VirtualJsonTree.cs) is a custom owner-drawn `Control`, not `TreeView`. `TreeView` allocates a `TreeNode` per node, which is fatal at millions of elements.

State:

`_visible: List<int>` is the flattened list of currently visible row ids (only expanded branches contributed).
`_depths: List<int>` is the matching depth per visible row.
`_openBranches: HashSet<int>` tracks which branches are open.

Opening or closing a branch splices descendants in or out of `_visible` and `_depths`. That is O(visible delta), not a full re-walk of the document. A 100M-element doc with everything collapsed has a `_visible` of size 1.

Paint draws only `ClientSize.Height / rowHeight` rows. GDI+ brushes and pens are cached in dictionaries keyed by `Color.ToArgb()`; allocating a `SolidBrush` per row per paint churns hundreds of GDI handles per second.

`Expand All` is disabled for documents with more than 1000 elements. There is no realistic way to display every node, and `List.InsertRange` on a 100M-entry list would be catastrophic.

Per-row string display is capped at 200 characters. `g.DrawString` degrades badly past ~10 KB inputs. The `DetailPanel` caps at 64 KiB for the same reason but keeps the full payload in `RawText` for clipboard copy.

## Progress reporting

`JsonTreeDocument` reports progress via `IProgress<ProgressInfo>`. The shim in [LoadingDialog](src/Forms/LoadingDialog.cs) marshals via `BeginInvoke` to the UI thread.

Two gotchas bit us; do not regress them.

Throttling: a 100M-element parse fires ~10 000 progress reports during the build pass. Without throttling, every one `BeginInvoke`s the UI thread; the message pump cannot keep up and the dialog stops repainting and stops responding to Cancel. The shim throttles step-3 in-progress reports to ~30 fps. Step transitions and the final `Progress >= 1.0` are always dispatched.

Bucket-diff vs modulo: the regular JSON path checks `Count % ProgressTick == 0` after every token, where `Count` increments by exactly 1, so every multiple is always seen. The JSONL path checks after every line, where `Count` jumps by however many tokens that line contained. If lines have a uniform shape (an object with 16 fields gives 17 tokens), `Count` never lands on a multiple of `ProgressTick` and the modulo check never fires; no progress, no cancellation, frozen dialog until the final `Progress=1.0`. Use the bucket-diff helper `ReportJsonlProgress`, which compares `Count - _lastProgressCount >= ProgressTick`. If you add a new parse path that updates `Count` in batches, use bucket-diff, not modulo.

## Frame pool

The build pass uses a per-parent `Frame { Children: List<int> }` to collect child ids before linking and (for objects) alphabetical sorting. Frames are pooled and reused via `RentFrame` / `ReturnFrame` in [JsonTreeDocument.cs](src/Core/JsonTreeDocument.cs).

`ReturnFrame` previously called `f.Children.Clear()`, which keeps the backing `int[]` capacity. After parsing a single wide array of N children, the frame's `Children` was sized to N; on the next parse, that capacity stayed pooled. For documents with a 50M-child array, that meant hundreds of MB retained across loads. The current code replaces `Children` with a fresh small `List<int>(4)` when capacity exceeds 1024. If you change the frame pool, do not regress this.

## Cancellation

Cancellation propagates from the modal `LoadingDialog`'s `CancellationTokenSource`. Inside parse loops, check `ct.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` at least every few thousand tokens or every chunk read. Do not put it inside the progress-fires gate; that is the bug we hit when modulo-progress never fired and cancellation rode along on it.

If parse throws `OperationCanceledException`, the dialog closes and `_doc` is left in a possibly partial state, but `_tree.Document` is never assigned (that only happens in `OnDocumentLoaded` after success). The next load calls `AllocateArrays`, which overwrites everything cleanly.

## Search and extract

Search uses [Wildcard.Compile](src/Core/Wildcard.cs) (depth-first, ignores the start node, returns the next match). Search runs on a `Task.Run` so the UI stays responsive; the search loop checks `ct.ThrowIfCancellationRequested` between nodes.

Extract walks a subtree via `Utf8JsonWriter` straight into a `MemoryStream`. No intermediate boxed objects. Only Array and Object can be extracted.

## Theming

WinForms has no native dark theme. [Theme.Apply](src/Theme.cs) walks the control tree at form-show time and swaps colors. Auto mode reads `AppsUseLightTheme` from `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Themes\Personalize`.

If you add a new control type, verify it picks up dark colors. Some WinForms controls (notably native scrollbars and menu drop shadows) ignore explicit color settings on .NET 8.

## Settings

[AppSettings](src/AppSettings.cs) is JSON-serialized to `%AppData%\Jasnote\settings.json`. Load and save failures are swallowed; they are best-effort. To add a field, add the property with a sensible default; `PropertyNamingPolicy = CamelCase` is already set; update [SettingsDialog](src/Forms/SettingsDialog.cs) if it should be user-facing.

## Things deliberately not done

Linux/macOS support: WinForms is Windows-only; cross-platform requires a different UI toolkit. A PR is welcome but it is effectively a fork.

Memory-mapped file I/O: [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) mentions it; the current code uses `ReadAllBytesAsync` for files <=1 GiB and chunked streaming above. The OS page cache makes the second pass effectively free for files that fit in RAM. mmap would only save 1 GiB of managed-heap pressure during the build pass and requires unsafe spans. Reconsider if profiling shows it is the bottleneck.

Find-all-matches UI: the current search workflow returns one match at a time and the user re-searches.

Streaming JSON (not JSONL) tokens larger than 1 GiB: a single token bigger than `MaxStreamChunkBuffer` errors out cleanly. Files where this happens are pathological.

Per-row text width caching during paint: `g.MeasureString` runs once per visible row per paint, about 3000 calls/sec at 60 fps with 50 rows. It is the largest sub-second perf cost during scroll but has not yet caused user-visible jank.

## Adding a feature

Match the existing style: Allman braces, file-scoped namespaces, ASCII-only in source files, no emojis or em dashes.

Read the surrounding code carefully. The hot paths in `JsonTreeDocument` and `VirtualJsonTree` have deliberate constraints (no per-node boxing, no per-paint allocation). Adding a `List<Foo>` in the parser path is almost always wrong; ask whether the data really needs to live anywhere other than the existing parallel arrays.

Verify the build passes:

```powershell
dotnet build .\src\Jasnote.csproj -c Release
```

Smoke-test against [sample.json](sample.json) and at least one large file (1 GiB or more) before claiming a change is done. Memory and timing regressions on big inputs do not show up on small inputs.

When changing parse code, watch for: allocations inside the token loop (anything you allocate runs O(N) where N can be 100M); memory not freed at parse end (`BuildContext` and any pooled state should reset cleanly); progress reports in batched-`Count` paths must use bucket-diff; cancellation must check at least every chunk or every few thousand tokens; the compact-array sizing must include any synthetic nodes (such as the JSONL root).

When changing UI code, watch for: per-paint allocations (brushes, pens, strings — cache them); `_visible.IndexOf(id)` is O(visible) and acceptable only when `_visible` is small (do not call it inside paint); operations on `JsonTreeDocument` from a background thread (the parallel arrays are not synchronized; reading them from paint while the build is mutating them will produce garbage, currently masked by `Enabled = false` on the main form during load).

## Performance: memory-saving techniques

This is the long-form rationale for the architectural decisions above. If you change parse code, this section is the test you have to pass: any new design must improve on or at least match the current memory budget.

### Boxed-tree pipeline to avoid

A common loader shape uses three observable steps and is easy to reason about, but it is too memory-heavy for Jasnote's target:

Step 1, load: a decoder reads the full file and produces a recursive boxed object graph: dictionaries for objects, lists for arrays, boxed numbers and booleans, strings, and null markers.

Step 2, size: a depth-first walk of that graph counts nodes. This adds little allocation, but the expensive graph already exists.

Step 3, render: another walk copies the graph into compact indexed storage. Object keys are sorted alphabetically per parent before adding. Progress and cancellation are checked on a fixed cadence.

### Where boxed trees spend memory

The dominant cost is the intermediate boxed tree built in step 1. For a multi-gigabyte JSON file with tens of millions of elements, that tree can be several times larger than the source data because:

Every dictionary entry pays hash-table overhead plus the key string and a boxed value reference. Numbers and booleans become boxed primitives. Strings carry both an object header and payload. Arrays add list headers plus backing arrays.

Even if the compact representation replaces that graph after render, peak memory is still the sum of the boxed tree plus the compact representation until the GC collects the old data.

Steady-state memory in a compact indexed form, per element:

`Node[]`: a key reference, boxed value reference, node type, and padding.
`int[] parents`: 4 bytes per node.
Parent-to-children map: hash-table overhead plus a child-list header per parent. Cheap for small documents, expensive when there are millions of parents.

So a compact indexed form can be reasonable at steady state, but the transient boxed-tree cost during load is still too high.

### How Jasnote adapts each step

Step 1 (avoid building a boxed tree). Jasnote runs `Utf8JsonReader` directly over the bytes. There is no intermediate tree at all. `Utf8JsonReader` is a `ref struct` that yields tokens without allocating per token. The only allocations during the count pass are short-lived: the reader state, a 256 KiB chunk buffer for the streaming path, and nothing else. This is the largest memory win in the parser.

Step 2 (count without a separate tree walk). Jasnote folds this into the first pass: `CountTokens` and `CountFromStreamAsync` accumulate `TotalCount` and `StringCount` while they read tokens. Same number of token reads, no separate tree to walk.

Step 3 (emit compact nodes). Jasnote's `BuildFromSpan` and `BuildFromStreamAsync` run a second token pass and emit nodes into pre-sized arrays. The `BuildContext` uses a `Stack<Frame>` to track open object/array frames; on `EndObject` the frame's collected children are sorted alphabetically by key via `span.Sort(new KeyComparer(Keys))` (struct comparer, no closure allocation) and then linked via `FirstChild` and `NextSibling`.

Per-element steady-state in Jasnote:

`byte[] Types`: 1 byte.
`string?[] Keys`: 8 bytes for the reference; key strings themselves are interned per parse.
`long[] Values`: 8 bytes discriminated slot.
`int[] Parents`, `int[] FirstChild`, `int[] NextSibling`: 12 bytes total.
`string[] StringPool`: 8 bytes per string node only (sized to the count of string values, not the total node count).

Total: 29 bytes per node plus a string-pool entry only for string-typed nodes. Compared with a compact-but-boxed indexed form, this removes boxed primitive values and per-parent child-list overhead on top of eliminating the transient object graph.

### Streaming and very large files

A full-tree loader does not stream. The full file must fit in RAM after expansion into managed objects, so failure mode is usually OOM.

Jasnote draws a line at 1 GiB (`InMemoryLoadLimit` in [JsonTreeDocument.cs](src/Core/JsonTreeDocument.cs)). At or below 1 GiB the file is `ReadAllBytesAsync`'d into a managed `byte[]` and parsed twice from that span; the OS page cache makes the second pass effectively free. Above 1 GiB the streaming path opens the file twice (`FileOptions.Asynchronous | FileOptions.SequentialScan`, 1 MiB buffer), reads in chunks, and feeds `Utf8JsonReader` with `isFinalBlock: false` plus persisted `JsonReaderState` across chunks. The buffer doubles up to 1 GiB if a single token (a huge string literal) does not fit; beyond that, the parser throws `InvalidDataException` instead of OOM.

For JSONL the streaming path is simpler: each line is a complete JSON value, so we split on `\n` at chunk boundaries and parse each completed line in isolation with `Utf8JsonReader(line, isFinalBlock: true, default)`. No reader state crosses lines, so a malformed line errors only on that line.

### Sorting object keys

Object keys still need stable alphabetical display order. A boxed-tree loader can sort key strings collected from each object after the object has been decoded.

Jasnote does the same but defers the sort to `EndObject` and sorts the collected child id list, comparing via a struct `KeyComparer` that reads `Keys[i]` for each id. `CollectionsMarshal.AsSpan(list).Sort(comparer)` avoids the lambda closure allocation that `List.Sort(Comparison)` would incur. For a 100M-element document with many objects, this saves on the order of N small allocations.

### Progress and cancellation cadence

Progress and cancellation use a fixed 10 000-node cadence in the parser. The reports are delivered to the WinForms loading dialog through `IProgress<ProgressInfo>`.

Jasnote uses the same 10 000 tick, but two implementation details matter:

WinForms has no built-in marshaling for arbitrary publishers, so the `LoadingDialog.ProgressShim` does its own `BeginInvoke` for each report. Without throttling, 10 000 `BeginInvoke`s flood the message pump on the UI thread and the dialog stops repainting and stops responding to Cancel. The shim throttles step-3 in-progress reports to ~30 fps (final and step-transition reports are always dispatched).

The cadence check itself must be a bucket-diff when `Count` updates in batches (as in the JSONL paths) rather than a modulo. See the Progress reporting section above for the full story; a uniform-line JSONL file with 17 tokens per line never lands `Count` on a multiple of 10 000 and the modulo never fires.

### Children: list per parent vs linked list

A parent-to-children map with one child list per parent is expensive for a 100M-element document with mostly singleton parents, which is typical of array-heavy JSONL. The map overhead alone can be hundreds of MB.

Jasnote stores children as a linked list (`FirstChild` + `NextSibling`). No per-parent map or slice header. The cost is that "get the Nth child" or "count children" walks the list, but neither operation is hot. The tree control accesses children in order via `FirstChild` then iteratively `NextSibling`, which is exactly what the linked-list layout optimizes for.

### Primitives boxed vs discriminated

A boxed-value design stores primitive values as object references. Every number and boolean pays object/interface overhead and adds GC tracking. With tens of millions of primitive values, this is a significant slice of heap.

Jasnote stores all primitive values in a single `long[] Values` slot whose interpretation is driven by `Types[i]`. No boxing. The trade-off is that all numbers are stored as `double` (acceptable for a viewer) and that strings need an extra indirection through `StringPool`. The cost of the indirection is one extra cache miss on string display; the saving is roughly 16 bytes per non-string primitive.

### Things that look like wins but are not

`MemoryMappedFile` for the in-memory path: the OS page cache is already free under the second-pass read of a `byte[]` whose contents came from the same file. mmap saves the ~1 GiB managed heap allocation during build but introduces unsafe spans. The trade is not worth it at current scale; revisit if profiling shows the managed `byte[]` as the bottleneck.

Parsing on multiple threads: `Utf8JsonReader` is inherently sequential because tokens depend on the surrounding context. You can split a JSONL file at line boundaries and parse lines in parallel, but the synchronization to insert into shared parallel arrays would dominate the savings unless the per-line work were substantial (it is not — each line is small).

`Span<int>` instead of `List<int>` for frame children: `List<int>` is needed for the doubling growth pattern. Using `int[]` directly forces pre-sizing or manual `Array.Resize`. We tried it; the build code became unreadable for no measurable gain. The pool replacement on capacity > 1024 is the meaningful fix.

`gcAllowVeryLargeObjects`: enabled by default on 64-bit .NET 8. No-op to set explicitly. Per-array length is still capped at `int.MaxValue` (~2.1 GiB), which is why the in-memory path limits at 1 GiB and the streaming path takes over.

## Lessons learned the hard way

1. `JsonReaderOptions.AllowMultipleValues` is .NET 9, not .NET 8. The codebase targets `net8.0-windows`; if you need multi-value parsing, use line splitting.
2. `List.Clear()` keeps the backing capacity. Pooled lists that have grown large must be replaced, not cleared.
3. `BeginInvoke` is not free. Tens of thousands of unthrottled `BeginInvoke`s freeze the UI thread.
4. `Count % N == 0` only fires when `Count` is a multiple. If `Count` jumps by varying amounts, use a bucket-diff.
5. `Utf8JsonReader.GetString()` on a 100 MB string token works fine, but `g.DrawString` does not. Cap display, keep the raw value for copy.
6. `byte[].Length` is capped at `int.MaxValue` (~2.1 GiB). On 64-bit .NET 8 this is the default array max even with `gcAllowVeryLargeObjects` (which is on by default). Files larger than 2 GiB cannot use the in-memory path.

That is the critical surface. Anything not covered here, infer from the code. Anything contradicted by the code, the code is the source of truth and this file is stale: please update it.
